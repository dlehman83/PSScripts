# PSScripts

This is a repository for Powershell scripts I have created.  

In most cases each sub folder is self contained, exceptions are documented.  

## Scripts

[CB Clear Profiles](/CBClearProfiles/) Will clear profiles from Chromebooks when they have less than 10% or less than 1GB of disk space for active devices. 

[Disable Expired AD Accounts](/DisableExpired/) This script will disable expired AD accounts so GCDS will suspend the users Google account.

[EMIS Reports](/EMIS%20Report/) is a simple script to copy an EMIS report from a SFTP server and email it.  

[Google Drive FileACSs](/GoogleDriveFileACL/) This script with gam commands will remove all file shares from an OU of users.  Used to stop sharing files owned by former staff or students.  

[SMTP Settings](/SMTPSettings/) is a dependency for other scripts to keep the SMTP server settings.  

[Azure MFA Pilot Group](/Azure/) is a script to put users into a group who have signed up for the Microsoft Authenticator app or registered a FIDO key in Azure.
