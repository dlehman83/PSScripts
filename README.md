# PSScripts

This is a repository for Powershell scripts I have created.  

In most cases each sub folder is self contained, exceptions are documented.  

## Scripts

[CB Clear Profiles](/CBClearProfiles/) Will clear profiles from Chromebooks when they have less than 10% or less than 1GB of disk space for active devices.  

[Emis Reports](/EMIS%20Report/) is a simple script to copy an EMIS report from a SFTP server and email it.  

[SMTP Settings](/SMTPSettings/) is a dependency for other scripts to keep the SMTP server settings.
